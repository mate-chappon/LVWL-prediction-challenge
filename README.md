# LVWL-prediction-challenge
This is a repository for the Lake Velence water level prediction challenge. Participants of the challenge will have to predict lake water levels in the beginning of each month for the days of the upcoming month throughout the year 2024, based on monthly weather forecasts and historical hydrological data of the catchment. 
To aquire historical data, catchment characteristics and operational rules for hydraulic structures, require access to the following g-drive folder.
By accessing data on the linked g-drive, you consent to using the accessed data only for the purposes of predicting lake water levels in Lake Velence within the framework of this scientific challenge.
