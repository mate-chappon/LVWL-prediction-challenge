# LVWL-prediction-challenge
This is a repository for the Lake Velence water level prediction challenge. Participants of the challenge will have to predict lake water levels in the beginning of each month for the days of the upcoming month throughout the year 2024, based on monthly weather forecasts and historic hydrological data of the catchment.
